LinkSat: Master-Slave Communication Simulator
LinkSat is a Python-based project that simulates real-time data communication between a Master and a Slave device using socket programming. It provides an interactive GUI for sending messages from the Master to the Slave, showcasing the fundamentals of network communication in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

Features
Master-Slave Communication: Send and receive messages between devices using TCP sockets.
Real-Time Simulation: Observe data exchange and acknowledgment responses in real-time.
Modern GUI: Dark-themed interface with a sleek, minimalist design.
Concurrency: Utilizes threading to handle multiple tasks without freezing the interface.
Message Logs: Displays communication logs for both Master and Slave sections.
Technologies Used
Python
Tkinter for GUI
Sockets for communication
Multithreading for concurrent processes
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Run python commlink.py to start the simulation.
Input a message in the Master section and click Send Message.
Watch the data flow and interactions between the Master and Slave devices in the logs.
